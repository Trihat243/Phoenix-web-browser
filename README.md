# Phoenix-web-browser
This is Phoenix, a java based web browser with ad blocking and tracker blocking that will never go away, and it can run on low end machines. (NOTE: the current version in this repo doesn't have these features yet)
# How do i contribute? and what is contributing?
You can contribute by adding your modified code to a pull request which is in the pull request tab. Contributing is helping to improve a project.
# How do i run or compile the browser?
you can do this by CDing into the folder that contains browser.java and then running either of these commands: javac browser.java (this turns the code into an executable file.) java browser.java (this runs the code without compiling it into an executable.)
